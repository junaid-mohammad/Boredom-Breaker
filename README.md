This repository contains the source code for **Boredom Breaker**, an engaging web app that fetches activity suggestions using the **Bored API**. Users can receive random suggestions or filter activities by type and participants. The project focuses on working with **RESTful APIs**, **query parameters**, and **server-side API requests** using **Axios**, while also incorporating modern, responsive front-end design.

## üéØ Purpose

**Boredom Breaker** was built as part of my learning journey to deepen my understanding of:

- **RESTful API requests** from the server side.
- **Structuring GET requests** with **path and query parameters**.
- Using **Axios** to make API calls from the server.
- Parsing and handling **JSON data**.
- Dynamically rendering data with **EJS**.
- Building responsive front-end layouts using **CSS**.
- Deploying apps with **Azure App Service** and managing **CI/CD** via **Azure DevOps**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Random Activity Suggestions**: Fetches a random activity when the page loads.
- **Custom Activity Filtering**: Users can filter activities by type and number of participants.
- **Server-Side API Requests**: Uses Axios to make server-side GET requests to the Bored API.
- **Error Handling**: Displays custom error messages if no matching activities are found.
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, modern UI that adapts across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Footer**: Displays the current year and author credit.

## üöÄ Deployment & Workflow

The **Boredom Breaker** app is hosted on **Microsoft Azure App Service** and deployed using **Azure DevOps**, with code managed on **GitHub**.

### üõ† Deployment Setup

The **Boredom Breaker** app is hosted on **Microsoft Azure App Service** with the code managed across **GitHub** and **Azure DevOps**.

### üõ† Deployment Setup (Steps I Took)

1. **Created Azure App Service**

   - Set up a new App Service instance through the Azure portal.

2. **Created GitHub Repo**

   - Initialized a new GitHub repository (`Boredom-Breaker`) and pushed all project files to it.

3. **Created Azure DevOps Project**

   - Created a project called _Boredom Breaker_ in Azure DevOps.

4. **Added Azure DevOps as a Git Remote**

   - Used the following to connect local code to Azure DevOps:
     ```bash
     git remote add azure https://Junaid-Arif@dev.azure.com/Junaid-Arif/Boredom%20Breaker/_git/Boredom%20Breaker
     ```

5. **Push to Both Remotes**

   - Pushed the same codebase to both GitHub (`origin`) and Azure DevOps (`azure`):
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     git push azure main
     ```

6. **Configured Azure App Service to Pull from Azure DevOps Repo**

   - In the App Service Deployment Center, linked the Azure DevOps repo for Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).

7. **Deployment Trigger Testing**

   - Confirmed that pushing to Azure DevOps automatically triggers a deployment to Azure App Service.

8. **Port Configuration**
   - The app already supports dynamic ports:
     ```javascript
     const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
     ```

### üî• Deployment Workflow (Current)

Whenever you update code:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main   # Pushes to GitHub
git push azure main    # Pushes to Azure DevOps and triggers deployment
